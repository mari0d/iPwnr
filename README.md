Just some code for remotely powering down/resetting iDevices. You will need the most recent lockdown plist from an OSX box that is paired with the iDevice. This can be found at /private/var/db/lockdown/ in Mavericks. Initial testing with iOS 8 indicates that there is now a somewhat unpredictable shelf-life for the lockdown plist.
